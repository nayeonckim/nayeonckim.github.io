I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University. I work with <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/sabine-kastner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabine Kastner</a> in the <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/napl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuroscience of Attention & Perception Laboratory</a>.  
Before coming to Princeton, I worked with <a href="https://mccarthylab.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregory McCarthy</a> as a research assistant after finishing my undergraduate studies in Cognitive Science at Yale University.

  I use neuroimaging methods to study the neural basis of the development of visual selective attention in middle childhood (roughly age 6 to 12). 
  My research emphasizes interactions between attention and various factors that also develop significantly within the age range, 
  such as sensory processing and higher-order cognitive skills (e.g., reading, math).
