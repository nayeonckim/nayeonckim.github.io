I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Riverside, where I direct the Attention and Neurodevelopment Laboratory (website coming soon!). I study how people vary in the way they perceive the world and pay attention to it, and how these processes differ in autism spectrum disorder and related clinical conditions. My lab employs fMRI, eye-tracking, and behavioral studies to investigate how perceptual and attention capacities facilitate higher-order cognition, such as complex social behavior. I am also passionate about using accessible technologies (e.g. smartphones and webcams) to reduce disparities in access to diagnosis, intervention, and research opportunities.

Prior to joining UCR, I was a postdoctoral scholar working with <a href="http://emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ralph Adolphs </a> at Caltech. I received my PhD in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience from Princeton University, where I worked with <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/sabine-kastner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabine Kastner</a> in the <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/napl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuroscience of Attention & Perception Laboratory</a>. I received my BA in Cognitive Science from Yale University and worked with <a href="https://psychology.yale.edu/people/gregory-mccarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greg McCarthy </a> as a research assistant.
