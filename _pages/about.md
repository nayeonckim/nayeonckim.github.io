<p>
I am a postdoctoral scholar working with <a href="http://emotion.caltech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ralph Adolphs </a> at California Institute of Technology. I use eye-tracking and functional MRI methods to study how attention facilitates social cognition and how it is affected in autism spectrum disorder. I received my PhD in Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience from Princeton University, where I worked with <a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/sabine-kastner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabine Kastner</a> in the <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/napl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuroscience of Attention & Perception Laboratory</a>.  
My PhD work investigated the neural basis of the development of visual selective attention in middle childhood (roughly age 6 to 12) with a focus on interactions between attention and various factors that also develop significantly within the age range, such as sensory processing and higher-order cognitive skills.
